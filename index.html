            <h2>Neatly Chaotic. Creatively Methodical.</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>I am a full-time tiny-living nomad who resides in the Pacific Northwest, bouncing between Portland and Seattle. My background is in the arts, and I am most excited about developing new tools for performers to collaborate digitally across disances. As a multidisciplinary artist myself, I find the ever-growing intermingling of technology and the arts to be most exciting. My natural inclinations toward linguistics and design have found themselves happily translated into programming, and I will eagerly talk anyone's ear off about what possibilities I imagine for their continued cross-pollination.  </p>

            <h2>A Fertile Curiosity, Persistently Indulged.</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>I enjoy being resourceful, self-sufficient, and a useful asset to others , and so I routinely pick up new skills to bolster my abilities. I pride myself on being a forever student, ever inquisitive and always experimenting. Brimming with soft skills from years of study and work in the performance arts, as well as service industry management. Presently working on adding new technical skills to my abilities to become both a more well rounded professional and artist. Bachelor's degree Theatre, Master's degree in creative writing, singer, musician, built my own websites for years, began incorporating more tech into my art, decided it was a route I wante to pursue to both incorporate into my creative process and to make a fulfillng career. Presently participating in Thinkful's (link) Engineering Immersion program to bring that aim to fruition.</p>
