            <h2>Neatly Chaotic. Creatively Methodical.</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>I am a full-time tiny-living nomad who resides in the Pacific Northwest, bouncing between Portland and Seattle. My background is in the arts, and I am most excited about developing new tools for performers to collaborate digitally across disances. As a multidisciplinary artist myself, I find the ever-growing intermingling of technology and the arts to be most exciting. My natural inclinations toward linguistics and design have found themselves happily translated into programming, and I will eagerly talk anyone's ear off about what possibilities I imagine for their continued cross-pollination.  </p>

            <h2>A Fertile Curiosity, Persistently Indulged.</h2>
            <hr>
            <p style="padding-bottom:.5vw">I enjoy being resourceful, self-sufficient, and a useful asset to others, and so I routinely pick up new skills that align with my interests. I pride myself on being a forever student, ever inquisitive and always experimenting. Brimming with soft skills from years of study and work in the performance and literary arts, I have been growing my technical abilities with the intention of becoming both a more well-rounded professional and more versatile artist.</p>
            <p style="padding-bottom:.5vw">With a bachelor's degree in acting, an MFA in creative writing, and an unwavering love of Google, I cobbled together my own music and writing websites for years, finding that I took great joy in the process. I've decided it is now a route to pursue seriously both to incorporate into my creative process and to craft a fulfillng career collaborating with others in new and equally engaging and challenging ways.</p>
            <p>Presently, I am participating in <a href="https://www.thinkful.com/bootcamp/web-development/full-time/" target="_blank">Thinkful's Engineering Immersion program</a> to bring that aim to fruition.</p>
